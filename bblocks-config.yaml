# A short, descriptive name of this building block collection
name: Wf4Ever Building Blocks

# Short abstract for this collection (optional)
abstract: |
  Building blocks for the Wf4Ever ontologies suite (wfdesc, wfprov, ro, wf4ever) enabling
  workflow description, provenance tracking, research object aggregation, and specialized artifact types.

# Description for this collection (optional)
description: |
  This repository contains four separate building blocks for the **Wf4Ever ontologies**:
  
  - **wfdesc**: Workflow Description Ontology for describing workflow structure (prospective provenance)
  - **wfprov**: Workflow Provenance Ontology for tracking execution traces (retrospective provenance)
  - **ro**: Research Object Ontology for packaging and aggregating research artifacts
  - **wf4ever**: Extension ontology providing specialized artifact types (File, Dataset, Document, Image) and process types (WebServiceProcess, WorkflowResearchObject)
  
  All examples are based on real CWL (Common Workflow Language) provenance data from
  scientific workflow executions.

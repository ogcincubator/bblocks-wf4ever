# ro:Folder

## Description

A **Folder** organizes resources within a Research Object. Folders provide a hierarchical structure, similar to file system directories, allowing logical grouping of related resources.

## Relations

- Contains `ro:FolderEntry` via `ore:aggregates`
- Can be aggregated in a `ro:ResearchObject`
- Can contain other Folders (recursive structure)

## Example

See the real-world example from a CWLProv execution showing a workflow output folder with multiple file entries (mangrove_mask.tif, biomass_summary.csv, carbon_summary.csv, analysis.json).
